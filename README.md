I can collecting and analyzing data to identify useful trends and provide management with relevant information that will facilitate informed decisions. 


[Project 1: Global Suprstore Analysis: Project Overview:](https://github.com/FadiaTaha/Global-Superstore-Analysis-Via-Python)


- Analyzed the data for 24 columns and 51290 rows via Python libraries.
- Made some manipulation. I extracted a new columns(Day, Month) from Order Date column. Moreover, I made price column by dividing Sale from Quantity columns.
- Asked questions to get a clear data. Finally, I created a tool to know the relation between three variables (multiple axis).
- we can see that the office supplies had the highest quantity of order because it had the lowest price.



[Project 2: Student performance Analysis: Project Overview:](https://github.com/FadiaTaha/Student-Performance-Project.)


- Create multiple aggregation tool in python to analyze data.
- In manipulation stage I extract new three columns through where.np to know who pass and fail in the test.
- Create codes to make data more readable by asking question that semplified data in tables and visually.


[Project 3: Corona-Virus cases and deaths per month in the global Via Tableau: Project Overviwe:](https://public.tableau.com/profile/fadia2965#!/vizhome/WHO-COVID-19-Global/Story1?publish=yes)

- Visualizing data to  follow the increasing of corona viruse deathes and case per month.
- First, worked on worksheet to analyze data.
- Second, Collected worksheets in a dashboard.
- Finally, created a story to give a full image of data.


[Project 4: Daimond Price Prediction: Project Overview:](https://github.com/FadiaTaha/Daimon-Price-Prediction)

- Used two dataset to predict daimond price.
-The problem in this project that I had to predict the daimond price in new dataset depenpend on old one.
- Used concatination function to combaine the two datasets in axis=0.
- Then made data preprocessing.
-Finally, Used linear regression to predict missing data in price column.
